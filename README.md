# Sorting Hat

This is my first official application built with React. This is a reimagined version of the famous NSS Sorting Hat Exercise.

Welcome to Hogwarts! All new students must be sorted into a House. 
This program allows the user to add students to be randomly assigned to the 4 different Hogwarts houses. 
If the student is expelled, then they are sent to join Voldemort's army. 
From there, they can be deleted entirely.
There is also an edit feature where the student's name and house can be edited.

## About the user
The ideal user would be someone that wants a fun way to randomly assign a group of people to smaller groups.

## Features
-New Students are added to an array of Hogwarts students and randomly assigned to a house.
-Once assigned, they are added to the DOM and the cards are sorted by House name.
-If the student is expelled, they are added to Voldemort's Army.
-Students' Name and House can be edited.
